# ETHMexico Hack - DictatorDAO

Dictator DAO is an experiment with an authoritarian DAO structure, inspired by open source [BDFLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life). The current DAO model with _democracatic_ governance proposals can be strong armed by rich individuals who can purchase voting tokens. The DD approach ensures the best DAOs best interests are in mind; however, it puts a lot of faith in the leader.

It also improves the autonomy of DAOs by creating a programatic way to pay maintainers of the organization and make on time payments to contributors.
